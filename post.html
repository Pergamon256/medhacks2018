    	The purpose of this study was to show how gesture can enhance math performance. It was an experimental research study that looked at how gesture effects children’s learning of math, particularly addition. The independent variable was gesture with three different conditions; gesture, no gesture, and partial gesture. The dependent variable of the study was the difference between pre- and post- test scores on a math task. The mediator variable was the speech being used during the lesson.<br /><br />

The lesson was where the independent variable changed. Participants were brought in for the study and were first given a demographics worksheet. Once their demographics were determined, they were given a pre-test to be aware of prior knowledge. Once the pre-test was graded, a lesson was given either with gesture that was grouping through two fingers, no gesture or a partial gesture which was just pointing. Once the lesson on the math was given, the post-test was given. The experimenters then determined a difference from pre- to post- tests scores.<br /><br />

The major conclusion to this study was that the gesturing condition showed higher math scores than the partially correct which was higher than the no gesture condition, showing that the gesturing actually aided in the child remembering the math task by using their body to perform it. <br /><br />

                <p class = "comment">  In this study there was no speech within the lesson. The only speech used was “This
side is equal to the other side.” This was the only speech used within the lesson. Since this was the only speech, the lesson was highly dependent on the use of the gestures, which in my opinion could be questionable. Should gesture be tested with more verbal instruction. Does the gesture give the same effect? One may also ask, does this relate to older or younger kids who are learning a different type of math? </p>
